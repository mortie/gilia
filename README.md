# Lang2

Lang2 is a programming language I'm working on.
It consists of a compiler which generates bytecode, and a VM which executes
that bytecode.

To get a feel for the language, you can look at the examples in the
[test/examples](https://git.mort.coffee/mort/lang2/src/branch/master/test/examples)
directory. The `.l2` files contain Lang2 source code, and the
`.expected` files contain the text which the Lang2 programs are expected to output.
